# MULTI-TOOL-XZ4
This is a web application built to learn different key element on developing a website.

On some date on December 2024 the XZ4 Multi-Tool was generated. I spent a week to master the html and css for the nav bar of the project. But originally, I started front end development a week before entering college, struggling to handle different programming language that time so I decided to make a pause for self projects and focus on building a foundation on back end side.
